   Now in this question, the idea is to identify the case where we can get a specific answer. When we iterate through the elements, and find a square (side length of 2), which is empty, we can basically fill it with 2 types -> "Multiple", that's the simplest case for Multiple. If we don't find anything of that sort, and just regular stuff -> "Unique", otherwise, "None"
