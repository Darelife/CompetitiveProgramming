# Trees
- Leaf Node : Has Degree 1
- Non-Leaf Node : Has Degree > 1

## Diameter of a Tree
- Diameter of a tree is the longest path between two nodes in a tree.
- Endpoints of a diameter are always leaf nodes.
- Diameter of a tree is the maximum of the following quantities:
    - Diameter of the left subtree
    - Diameter of the right subtree
    - Longest path between two nodes which passes through the root.

## Properties of Trees
- There exists a unique path btwn any two nodes in a tree.
- Number of edges in a tree = N-1, where N is the number of nodes.
- Sum of degree of all nodes = 2*(N-1)
- A tree can't have less than 2 leaf nodes, unless it's a single node tree.
- There can't be any cycle in a tree.
